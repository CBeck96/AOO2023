# Cumulative incidence function 

# This function works in the set-up of competing risk, where the states are:
# Healthy, Diagnosed, emigration, and death. The function also takes into account 
# late entry. 
# Tstart,Tslut, and censor_stat is described in the Data description. 

# Packages used:
# prodlim

# Input:
# dat    : Data used. Takes a data frame
# se     : Indicator to include confidence intervals. Default is False. 

# Output: 
# Gives a list of the following
#   1) CIR: A data frame containing: 
#        - time given in ages
#        - Survival 
#        - Cumulative incidence for the state diagnosed
#        - Cumulative incidence for the state emigration
#        - Cumulative incidence for the state death
#   2) lower: Lower confidence limits (Structure as above, without time)
#   3) upper: Upper confidence limits (Structure as above, without time)
#   4) model: Model fitted on the data
